            HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the cornerstone of the whole world wide web. 
            This markup language has been the backbone (ribs, arms, and legs) of webpages for decades. 
            From your personal GeoCities page back in high school to your Myspace account in high school, HTML has been serving 
            the internet to you in an easily read format for a while. You may still remember a lot of the language from personalizing 
            your Myspace with glittery GIFs and tight tiled backgrounds.
        </p>
        <p>
            A webpage is more than just HTML, of course. Modern day websites employ CSS and Javascript often, but, still, 
            it all starts with the HTML. You make the general cite with HTML and then you build out its style with CSS, 
            just like a skin, and its capabilities with Javascript - kind of like its muscles.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of this code is stored on a server, and, as you know, you must use a web browser to connect to the website 
            stored on the server. Your browser parses the code, then it constructs the site.
        </p>
        <p>
            Websites have a <em>lot</em> of moving parts, and rely on many types of code. This particular site - though using 
            HTML and CSS - will focus primarily on HTML.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Basics">
        <header>Basics</header>
        <p>
            There are several elements a website's code should always have. Think of it like the formatting for a research 
            paper or an essay. Each paper, or website, should have headings formatted with specific standards.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a high school or college class your papers will always have a heading in the upper, left-hand corner 
            of your first page just like this:
        </p>
        <code>
            Jack Doe<br>
            Prof. Jane Doe<br>
            Intro to HTML<br>
            1 January, 2001
        </code>
        <p>
            Your HTML code will have a heading as well. It does not contain detailed documentation as this part is not 
            for people to read, but is, instead, intended for the browser. This heading will look like this:
        </p>
        <code>
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        </code>
        <p>
            This is not all your code will need, though. You also have to nest all the code into the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element.
            HTML elements will nearly always have a corresponding element closing it off, just like this:
        </p>
        <re>
        <code>
            &lt;html&gt;<br>
            YOUR CODE HERE<br>
            &lt;/html&gt;
        </code>
        </re>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Elements">
        <header>Elements</header>
        <p>
            Now there has been many references to <b>elements</b>, but what is an element?
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>HTML Element</b> page on Wikipedia defines it like this:
            <p class="tab">
                "An <b>HTML Element</b> is an individual component of and HTML document or webpage."
            </p>
            That sounds a little vague, so here are a few examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>&lt;body&gt; = The body element defines the body of the webpage. Everything you have been reading is in the body</code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;h1&gt; = First heading</code></li>
            <li><code>&lt;p&gt; = Paragraph</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These are the most common elements used on webpages, especially by beginners. This is not a comprehensive list.
            Many more elements exist, and many have varied forms. The <code>h1</code> tag, for instance, has slight 
            variations like:
            <ul>
                <li><code>&lt;h2&gt;</code></li>
                <li><code>&lt;h3&gt;</code></li>
                <li><code>&lt;h4&gt;</code></li>
            </ul>
            Notice the declination in numbers by the heading tag. The heading tags transform the text nested inside.
            Text is made bold and the font-size is made large. Now as you decrease the heading number, so will the 
            font-size decrease. Treat it like a sub-heading in an essay.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember, many elements have items nested in them. That means an end tag should follow the contents of the 
            element. The <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> element should be followed up by the 
            <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>  , and the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element should be followed by <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>  .
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
        <header>Attributes</header>
        <p>
           As mentioned before, when using elements such as <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> you
           nest your paragraph inside. That is simple, but more can be done with the element by using <b>attributes</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            An attribute is directly associated with the element. Instead of inserting the attribute between the two tags
            of the element like this:
        </p>
        <code>
            &lt;p&gt; <b>attribute</b> &lt;/p&gt;
        </code>
        <p>
            you should, instead, insert the attribute <em>inside</em> the first tag itself. Like this:
        </p>
        <code>
            &lt;p <b>attribute</b>&gt; content &lt;/p&gt;
        </code>
        <p>
            The end tag will not contain anything pertaining to the attribute.
        </p>
        <p>
            This far part of the syntaxic relationship between attributes and elements has been explained, but
            what <em>is</em> an attribute? <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp" title="w3schools.com">W3schools.com</a>
            says, "Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements." Simply that means it is a tool that
            allows elements to have extra skills. Notice the citation for w3schools in this paragraph. It is shown as 
            a link, and that link was made with an attribute. The attribute <code>href=""</code> can be used with the 
            element <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>, also referred to as an anchor, to create a link. A website's URL is added
            between the quotation marks of the <code>href=""</code> attribute to point to the location the link will 
            take the end-user. It will look like this:
        </p>
        <code>
            &lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp"&gt;
        </code>
        <p>
            Now if the end-user simply hovers their cursor over the link without clicking on it, the name 
            <b>w3schools.com</b> appears in a box alongside the cursor. This is created by using the attribute 
            <code>title=""</code> where text is written inside the quotation marks of the attribute. The entire
            element of the link looks like this:
        </p>
        <code>
            &lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp" title="w3schools.com"&gt;W3schools.com&lt;/a&gt;
        </code>
        <p>
            The actual text of the link being clicked on is nested between the anchor elements.
        </p>
        <p>
            Attributes always effect the contents of the element it is attributed. Here is an attribute that will 
            apply stylistic changes to the element. This attribute is aptly named <code>style=""</code>  . Think 
            of this as a text-based version of the font bar on a wordprocessing program. Text-based may sound 
            intimidating at first, but it is really rather simple. No, there is no visual representation to the 
            functions available, and, yes, that means all the functions are memorized. It is actually more simple 
            than one may think. There is more freedom here than scouring through menu after menu to find the tool 
            needed. It has been said, in reference to commandlines and text-based programming, that it is the 
            <em>fastest</em> way to preform a task than any other way.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>style=""</code> attribute will let you change font color, font size, and background color, just 
            to name a few. Take a look at a few examples.
        </p>
        <code>
            &lt;p style="font-size:36px"&gt;The quick brown fox&lt;/p&gt;
        </code>
        <p class="example" style="font-size:36px;">
            The quick brown fox
        </p>
        <p>
            Building off this:
        </p>
        <code>
            &lt;p style="color: red; font-size:36px;"&gt;The quick brown fox&lt;/p&gt;
        </code>
        <p class="example" style="color: red; font-size: 36px;">
            The quick brown fox
        </p>
        <p>
            Once again, these are just a few examples of different type of attributes. There are too many examples 
            to show here. The <b>w3schools</b> website is an excellent resources for all kinds of attributes available 
            in HTML.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Formatting">
        <header>Formatting</header>
        <p>
            Building off of the style attribute from the last section, there are other ways to add stylistic elements 
            to HTML text on a webpage. It <em>is</em> an element, truly. <b>Formatting</b> is a small way to give text 
            unique qualities, compared to the other text surrounding it, by using in-text elements. Notice the word "formatting" in the 
            preceding sentence. The word has been made bold. Returning to the previous example of the word processing 
            program, a button can be selected to transform text into and emboldened state. This same function can 
            be done in HTML with the <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> element. The same was done with the word "is" in the sentence 
            preceding that by using <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>  .
        </p>
        <p>
            Why is this called formatting? It is not like the formatting of a college essay, so, again, why is this 
            called formatting? <b>W3schools</b> says, "HTML uses elements like <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and 
            <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> for formatting output, <b>bold</b> or <i>italic</i> text." A lot of the elements 
            covered here are on the "micro" side of things, <b>style</b> and <b>formatting</b> primarily format text, 
            not the large scale, or "macro", layout of a page.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Classes">
        <header>Classes</header>
        <p>
            To make changes on the large scale side of the HTML, the <code>&lt;class=""&gt;</code> attribute can be used 
            to edit or transform the multiple elements it is associated. Notice how the heading and paragraph of each 
            section on this webpage are uniform in style. All the headings and paragraphs have the same font-family, 
            font-size, and indentation. The header and paragraph are nested inside a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element 
            with the attribute <code>&lt;class=""&gt;</code>  , which in practice looks like this:
        </p>
        <code class="example">
            &lt;section class="main-section"&gt;<br>
                &lt;p&gt; TEXT &lt;/p&gt;<br>
            &lt;/section&gt;
        </code>
        <p>
            There is another language commonly used on websites called CSS. The style attribute employees some CSS to 
            change the appearance of HTML. Class attributes are typically used in conjunction with CSS to modify any 
            elements associated with a specific class. Using the CSS style sheet alongside the class attribute multiple 
            attributes can be added to an element with much less clutter. The CSS on this page looks similar to this:
        </p>
        <code class="example">
            &lt;style&gt;<br>
            .main-section{<br>
            font-family: courier;<br>
            font-size: 16px;<br>
            }<br>
            &lt;/style&gt;
        </code>
         <p>
            The CSS command that references the associated class it is modifying is a period with no space 
            preceding the name of the class. When <code>&lt;section class="trombone"&gt;</code> is modified 
            using CSS, it is referenced with <code>.trombone{}</code>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="IDs">
        <header>IDs</header>
        <p>
            A class attribute is used with CSS to stylize multiple elements, but the <b>ID</b> attribute is 
            used to make large scale changes the contents of a single element. ID attributes are added to 
            elements the same way as class attributes.
        </p>
        <code class="example">
            &lt;section id="example"&gt;
        </code>
        <p>
            Within the style sheet, though, it is referenced with pound sign, or hashtag, like this:
        </p>
        <code class="example">
            &lt;style&gt;<br>
            #example {<br>
            }<br>
            &lt;/style&gt;
        </code>
        <p>
            ID attributes can also be used with the class attribute. 
        </p>
        <code class="example">
            &lt;section class="main-section" id="example"&gt;
        </code>
        <p>
            This page uses the ID attribute alongside the class attribute, but not for further stylistic 
            changes. The menu, with links to each section of this document, is linked to each sections ID 
            attribute. This is what allows the link to jump to the section selected.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each item in the list of options has an <code>href=""</code> attribute associated with it that 
            references its contents, being the ID of each section, then scrolls the page location down to 
            the section selected.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Summary">
        <header>Summary</header>
        <p>
